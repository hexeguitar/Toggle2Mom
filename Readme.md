## Toggle to momentary switch converter

![alt text][pic1]

Simple circuit that converts a toogle switch into a double/single momentary one, generating short pulses on rising or falling edges.
Thanks to the opto isolated outputs it can be used in button matrix systems.
Might be a handy trick when building panels in DIY cockpits, whenever there is a need for a toogle switch, but the hardware expects a pushbutton.

Both outputs can be used separately to generate two "on" and "off" press events.
Alternatively, by connecting J7+J5 and J6+J4 together it will generate a single press event for both actions.

A perfboard layout is included in the PDF file.
